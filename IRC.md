# Gandi's Community IRC channel

Gandi has an official #gandi IRC channel on the Freenode network. It's a place where Gandi users, Gandi employees and curious onlookers can hang out, ask questions and exchange with others.

Feel free to join at irc://irc.freenode.net/gandi

* Server: irc.freenode.net
* Port: 6667 (SSL Port: 6697)
* Channel: #gandi

People who don't have an IRC client installed can use the [webchat](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=gandi) provided by Freenode.

## This is not an official support channel

Some Gandi employees (who are voiced in the channel) might be online and happy to help, but please note that this channel isn't officially monitored by our customer care team. You may also find some fellow Gandi customers who are able to help.

If you're able to solve your problem thanks to the people in this channel, great! Otherwise, the only official way to get help is to [open a ticket](https://www.gandi.net/support/contact/mail/) or contact us via live chat from within your account.

## Guidelines

We ask you to keep the following things in mind when present on #gandi.

* Be a [catalyst](https://freenode.net/catalysts.shtml). 
* Be patient; there may not always be someone available who can help you. Just ask your question, and stay in the channel. If no one answers, please [open a ticket](https://www.gandi.net/support/contact/mail/) and leave the ticket number (from the subject of the autoreply email) in the channel before signing off, so we can follow up.
* Don't ask if you can ask a question, just ask your question, and provide enough information in case someone comes along who can help.
* If you find an answer to your own question, please say so and share your solution to help others.
* This is a public channel. Don't provide your account details or other sensitive information; if it's needed, open a ticket.
* When pasting large amounts (i.e. more than 5 lines) of code or text, make a pastebin instead. (link?)

### Help us help you

If you have a question or a problem:

* Check the [status page](http://status.gandi.net/) and the [news feed](https://www.gandi.net/news/en/) to see if there's a known issue or scheduled maintenance.
* If you haven't already, take a moment to search the [Gandi wiki](http://wiki.gandi.net/).
* If you didn't find an answer in the docs, please provide us with the search path you followed while searching the documentation, so we can improve it for other users.
* It never hurts to search engine. You'll often find that Gandians are willing to move mountains to help those who practice the ancient art of asking, described particularly well [here](https://workaround.org/getting-help-on-irc) and [here](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html).
