# Gandi community 

## Who is Gandi?

Gandi is a domain name registrar and innovative cloud hosting company. We are different from other companies in this market in that we set respect for customer rights as our first priority.

We offer an alternative approach to that of our competitors, spending no money on advertising. Instead, we [lend our resources](https://www.gandi.net/supports/) to the community of people and groups working on improving the internet, fighting for freedom of information, and for promoting the respect of individual and human rights.
